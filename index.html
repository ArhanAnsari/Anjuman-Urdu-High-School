            <h3>About Our School</h3>
            <p>The institution is founded by the forefathers of Memon family in 1938 but due to 
                the lack of resources and inadequate atmosphere it has to stop the educational 
                work in 1948. <br>
                But in 1958 a great young devoted person Late Alhaj Abdul Sattar Ibrahim seth 
                kacchi from the memon family arise with full courage having the pious spirit of 
                social service to impart the education. <br>
                The institution is flourishing and spreading the knowledge and education not 
                only to the people of Shegaon but also to the resource less students coming from 
                the villages adjacent to the town. <br> 
                The Institution runs the school from Ist standard to 12th standard. The 
                infrastructure of the school is catering the educational needs of the students from 
                the shegaon and vicinity. <br>
                The institution has got the energetic and selfless leader like Mohd Rafique seth 
                Memon Sb who has made the radical changes in the organization with his hard 
                work and devotion. The School is turned into the jr college of science in 2000 
                and it has started the Arts section in 2005. It empowered the people coming 
                from the poor background. It has given the opportunity to those students who 
                have to quit the education due to the poor financial condition.</p>
